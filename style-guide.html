        <h2>COLOUR PALETTE</h2>
        <p>The brands colour palette is based around multiple shades of dark and bright colours of grey and aqua which are contrasted with a light blue shade and complimented shades of a peach orange and pale yellow. I wanted to keep the colour scheme clean and sophisticated.

        <h2>VISUAL MARQUE</h2>
        <p>Our brand is communicated through our Visual Marque, reflecting apoun the brands connection with on screen design and creativity. The crown represents my first name 'Sarah' which actually means princess in the Hebrew language. So, I wanted to use this to make the brand more unique and to also represent me. Therefore I created the illustration of the crown to portray that. In contrast, I wanted to include my relation within the design industry, this is defined through the pen illustration below the crown. Thus, these two merged together communicate both, the innovative yet fun aspect relating to the brand and its work.

        <h2>MONOGRAM</h2> 
    
        <p>The monogram is a combination of a two letters I designed using Illustrator. A Large Letter S and a smaller letter O, both representing my initials. I wanted to keep with the theme revolving the visual marque. I wanted the brand's monogram to have a joined up element and by doing so I wanted to enhance the curves that are situated with both these letters. Allowing it to flow smooth and naturally. Along with that, It's also a very precise and clean design, making it easily readable.

        <h2>WORDMARK & TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
    
    
        <p>The brands typography is based on two san serif typefaces, Josefin Sans and Open Sans. San serif has been chosen to make typography used throughout branding material easily read, clean and overall tasteful. To style the brands typography for elements such as headings, sub-headings, quotes and body, a range of weights and styles are used. The typeface Open Sans has soley been used for the brands wordmark. The use of this font portrays the brands Name in a professional manner as well as making it pleasing to the viewers eye.</p>

    <img src="images/wordmark.svg" width="300px;" alt="wordmark"/>
 

<p>When both these typefaces are used in combination with the Visual Marque, the straight cut edges and sharp points compliment the angular shapes within the Visual Marque. in order to keep the branding consistant these angular shapes are used throughout all material. No other typefaces are permitted.</p>
